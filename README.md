This is Task-02 of my Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech
The goal was to develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation in Python
I implemented:
Encryption: Pixel values are mathematically transformed and shuffled using a key
Decryption: The encrypted image is restored back to its original form using the same key
